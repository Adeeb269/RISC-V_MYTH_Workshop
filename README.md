## HELP!!!

It's important to take your time with each concept and with each lab. Rushing ahead will slow you down in the end.

When you get stuck:
  1. Check the information below for course corrections, updated during the workshop. (Reload this page if it's been up for a while.)
  1. Review previous lectures.
  1. Explore the <a href="http://www.makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=" target="_blank" atom_fix="_">Reference Solutions</a>. No, we're not giving away the answers. This link will open code in Makerchip that you can use to see solutions -- not the source code, but the Makerchip diagrams, waveforms, and visualizations. Explore these to figure out the issue that's plaguing you, and then go back to doing the lab on your own. If you are stuck on syntax, hover over a signal assignment in the diagram to see an expression.
  1. There is a WhatsApp Group for everyone in the workshop, both students and mentors: ??
  1. There is a TL-Verilog help room available during the workshop for individual assistance: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4218739141&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1595603520903000&usg=AOvVaw1ndmQzaikr7nHGZKKa5-PI" target="_blank" atom_fix="_">TL-Verilog Zoom Room</a>

## Common Errors

### SandPiper(TM) (blue log output)

### Verilator (black log output)

#### Verilated model didn't DC converge

Combinational logic loops back on itself. Perhaps you missed a `>>1`.
